<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Pyexclient is a Python client for the Expel Workbench. If you can click it in the UI, you can also automate it with our APIs. Want to build a custom report? Integrate Expel Workbench with your SOAR platform? Pyexclient can help you acommplish that and more!


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Pyexclient requires `python>=3.7`.

### Installation

To install Pyexclient, use pip.

```sh
pip3 install pyexclient
```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can get started with Pyexclient in two easy steps:

**Step 1: Authenticate to Workbench**

You can authenticate with your Expel Workbench credentials:
```py
import getpass
from pyexclient import WorkbenchClient

wb = WorkbenchClient(
        'https://workbench.expel.io',
        username=input("Username: "),
        password=getpass.getpass("Password: ",
        mfa_code=input("MFA Code: ")
    )
```

Alternatively, you can authenticate with an API key (useful for long running scripts). Contact your Expel Engagement Manager to request an API key.
```py
import getpass
from pyexclient import WorkbenchClient

wb = WorkbenchClient(
        'https://workbench.expel.io',
        token=getpass.getpass("API Token: ")
    )
```

**Step 2: Start Exploring!**

In the example below, we're printing investigations:
```py

for inv in wb.investigations:
    print(inv)
```

_For more examples (we have a ton!), please refer to the [Documentation](https://pyexclient.readthedocs.io).
