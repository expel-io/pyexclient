Getting Started
===============
There’s one precondition to using pyexclient: you must have a Workbench user account. This means you need to be a customer or going through a POC with Expel. 

If you have an Expel Workbench account, you can authenticate to :ref:`Expel using MFA <snippet auth>` Expel using MFA or you can request an API key. 


Requesting an API key
---------------------
To get an API key, you’ll need to reach out to your Expel Engagement Manager. In the future we’ll make the API key generation a self-serviceable feature.

Installation
------------
Pyexclient requires Python3.7+. It has no additional dependencies. 

To install pyexclient using pip, run: 

.. code-block:: bash 

    $ pip3 install pyexclient
